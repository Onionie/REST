# REST / RESTful app
This application is a very simple app that I made to practice REST and RESTful API. Applied different methods such as, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Used postman to help with API development.

# Tools Used
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS
- MongoDB + mongoose
- Postman

# How to use or run
Using terminal and node:
- npm i express
- npm i body-parser
- npm i ejs
- npm i mongoose
- then run locally "localhost:3000"
- use postman to play with the API
